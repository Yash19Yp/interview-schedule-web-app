Without vesting more time lets talk about project.

I have created this project in php, html5, css ,mysqlite.

On the first page there is a separeate login for Student and recruiter..

For login I already have created a user id and password which is ention below.

For student LOgin id is : user1 
password: user123

for recruiters login id is: user2
password: user234

i have only added this 2 users so please kindly use this id and password for login.

And one more thing if you have downloaded my project from github then kindly check the css file and a one image is there which needs to be in folder so pls create a folder name css and another folder name image and move both the files to th appropriate folders...........
Thank you......
